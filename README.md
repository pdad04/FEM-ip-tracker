## Overview

### The challenge

In this challenge, you'll be using two separate APIs together to create an IP Address Tracking app that allows users to search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location.

### APIS

- [IP Geolocation by Ipify](https://geo.ipify.org/)
- [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/)

## My process

### Built with

- Custom CSS
- React
- Leaflet / React leaflet for Map
- Ipify API for IP Geolocation

### What I learned

Continued with using a mobile-first workflow. I had to look up some flexbox tips/tricks and still not feeling 100% comfortable with using flexbox, in terms of writing it in an optimized way, i.e I feel like I'm having to rely on media queries more than I should need to using flexbox.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell - Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/KepowOb) - Kevin's channel has helped me understand more about CSS responsive design as well as CSS best practices in general.
